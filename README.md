## Graduate Programming Language Exam Guidelines (English Department)

Knowledge of computer languages can both reveal new literary-cultural
formations and serve as a powerful tool for the study of such formations, at
micro- and macro scales. However, it should not be viewed as a substitute for
foreign language proficiency, except for cases where such substitution is
convincingly justified and where it is warranted by sustained, deep engagement
with the material.

This document contains rationale and general guidelines to be consulted when
considering graduate student requests to fulfil their foreign language as a
programming (computer) language. The accompanying document contains a sample
exam.

- Proficiency in a computer/artificial language should generally be viewed as
  a supplement to foreign languages.

- The substitution is allowed in cases where a student's work benefits from
  computational literacy either as a subject or a method of study.

- The student should be encouraged to articulate the exception in writing, in
  the form of a concise (one page) proposal.

There are two specific cases where a computer language as a foreign language
request is particularly appropriate:

1. Where a student's projected research program involves aspects of
   computational culture as a *subject* of study. These include (but not
limited to) topics in electronic literature, software studies, game studies,
online deliberation, combinatorial poetics, virtual communities, fan culture,
media studies, platform studies, sociology of knowledge, book piracy, politics
of the archive, human--computer interaction, and history and future of the
book, among other potentially relevant applications. The student should
describe the scope of his or her project, relevant technologies involved, and
a brief synopsis of secondary literature of the kind that models deep
engagement with a computer language. Specific languages in this category will
often include historical or otherwise obscure dialects. Examples from proposed
studies include *Fortran*, *6502 Assembler (Nintendo)*, and *Perl*.

2. Where computer languages are used instrumentally, as a *method* of study.
   For example, medievalists may wish to acquire reading knowledge of German
to understand the secondary literature in that language. Similarly, a scholar
of Victorian British Literature may wish to learn Python to facilitate
analysis of numerous texts across long periods of time. The proposed language
in this category should reasonably belong to the category of major "research
languages" which includes *Python*, *R*, *C*, *Java*, and *Julia*. The list
does not include markup languages such as *HTML*, *CSS*, or *LaTeX*.
